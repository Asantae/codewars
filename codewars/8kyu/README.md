                        #Rules:

#Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.
For example:
summation(2) -> 3
1 + 2
summation(8) -> 36
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8

String to Number

                        #Rules:

#We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?
Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.
Examples
"1234" --> 1234
"605"  --> 605
"1405" --> 1405
"-7" --> -7

                        #Rules:

#Code as fast as you can! You need to double the integer and return it.

Sum Arrays

-[tests](./8kyujs/sum-arrays.test)
-[other-solutions](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53dc54212259ed3d4f00071c/solutions/javascript)
                       
                        #Rules:

#Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. The numbers can be negative or non-integer. If the array does not contain any numbers then you should return 0.
Examples
Input: [1, 5.2, 4, 0, -1]
Output: 9.2
Input: []
Output: 0
Input: [-2.398]
Output: -2.398
Assumptions
You can assume that you are only given numbers.
You cannot assume the size of the array.
You can assume that you do get an array and if the array is empty, return 0.
What We're Testing
We're testing basic loops and math operations. This is for beginners who are just learning loops and math operations.
Advanced users may find this extremely easy and can easily write this in one line.

Powers of 2

                        #Rules:

#Complete the function that takes a non-negative integer n as input, and returns a list of all the powers of 2 with the exponent ranging from 0 to n ( inclusive ).
Examples:
n = 0  ==> [1]        # [2^0]
n = 1  ==> [1, 2]     # [2^0, 2^1]
n = 2  ==> [1, 2, 4]  # [2^0, 2^1, 2^2]

                        #Rules:

#You will be given a vector of strings. You must sort it alphabetically (case-sensitive, and based on the ASCII values of the chars) and then return the first value.
The returned value must be a string, and have "***" between each of its letters.
You should not remove or add elements from/to the array.

Twice as Old

                        #Rules:

#Your function takes two arguments:
current father's age (years)
current age of his son (years)
Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).
