                        #Rules:

#Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.
For example:
summation(2) -> 3
1 + 2
summation(8) -> 36
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8

                        #Rules:

#We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?
Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.
Examples
"1234" --> 1234
"605"  --> 605
"1405" --> 1405
"-7" --> -7
