These are all of the 7kyu's I've solved as well as my solutions

                        #Rules:

#Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string. We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y). The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or #spaces.

                        #Rules:

#Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.
If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA
In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).
More similar exercise are found here: http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/ (source)
Example: (input --> output)
"ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
"GTAT" --> "CATA"

                        #Rules:

#Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.
Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.
The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between.
Examples:
number([]) // => []
number(["a", "b", "c"]) // => ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]
#
